## Why Cydia Plus Special?

Cydia, once the reigning app manager for older iOS versions, held a prominent position in the jailbreaking community. It was the default choice for enthusiasts who sought to customize their devices beyond Apple‚Äôs restrictions.
Collaborating seamlessly with popular jailbreak tools like Checkra1n, Unc0ver, Chimera, Electra, Pangu, TaiG, Yalu Jailbreak, Meridian, and Phoenix, Cydia became synonymous with the jailbreaking experience.

However, in 2018, the original Cydia developer, Saurik, ceased updating the platform. The decline in untethered jailbreaking‚Äôs popularity contributed to this decision.

Cydia Plus is a modified version developed by the Cydia Plus team. This alternative to Cydia caters specifically to the latest iOS versions. It empowers users to install jailbreak tweaks and third-party apps without requiring an untethered jailbreak on their devices. A fresh approach for a new era of iOS customization.

*Important: Cydia Plus is not the official Cydia. Instead, it's a modified version that supports both jailed and jailbroken iPhone and iPad devices on all the latest iOS versions, making device customization easy without the need for jailbreaking.*
