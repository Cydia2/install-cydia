## Why Cydia Plus Special?

Cydia, once the reigning app manager for older iOS versions, held a prominent position in the jailbreaking community. It was the default choice for enthusiasts who sought to customize their devices beyond Appleâ€™s restrictions.
Collaborating seamlessly with popular jailbreak tools like Checkra1n, Unc0ver, Chimera, Electra, Pangu, TaiG, Yalu Jailbreak, Meridian, and Phoenix, Cydia became synonymous with the jailbreaking experience.

However, in 2018, the original Cydia developer, Saurik, ceased updating the platform. The decline in untethered jailbreakingâ€™s popularity contributed to this decision.

Cydia Plus is a modified version developed by the Cydia Plus team. This alternative to Cydia caters specifically to the latest iOS versions. It empowers users to install jailbreak tweaks and third-party apps without requiring an untethered jailbreak on their devices. A fresh approach for a new era of iOS customization.
